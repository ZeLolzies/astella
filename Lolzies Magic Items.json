				"A nonsuspecting silver ring that harbors a deep dwelling in vendettas. This ring is invisible when worn and cannot be detected by any magical-sensing means.",
				"{@b {@i Enact Vengeances.}} As a bonus action, the wearer can cause the ring to show its true form: a shadow curved knife resembling a claw that fits perfectly in the palms of its wearer. This magic dagger lasts until dispelled or if hidden again as a bonus action. It deals 2d8 psychic damage on a hit and has the finesse, and light properties."
